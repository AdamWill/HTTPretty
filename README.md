# What

HTTPretty is a HTTP client mock library for Python 100% inspired on ruby's [FakeWeb](http://fakeweb.rubyforge.org/)

# Motivation

When building systems that access external resources such as RESTful
webservices, XMLRPC or even simple HTTP requests, we stumble in the
problem:

    "I'm gonna need to mock all those requests"

It brings a lot of hassle, you will need to use a generic mocking
tool, mess with scope and so on.

## The idea behind HTTPretty (how it works)

HTTPretty [monkey matches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch)
Python's [socket](http://docs.python.org/library/socket.html) core
module, reimplementing the HTTP protocol, by mocking requests and
responses.

This is a nice thing, if you consider that all python http modules
are supposed to get mocked.

# Usage

    from httpretty import HTTPretty
    HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.GET, "http://globo.com/",
                           body="The biggest portal in Brazil")

    fd = urllib2.urlopen('http://globo.com')
    got = fd.read()
    fd.close()

    print got

**:: output ::**

    The biggest portal in Brazil

## rotating responses

    HTTPretty.register_uri(HTTPretty.GET, "http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty",
                           responses=[
                               HTTPretty.Response(body="first response", status=201),
                               HTTPretty.Response(body='second and last response', status=202),
                            ])

    request1 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
    body1 = request1.read()
    request1.close()

    assert that(request1.code).equals(201)
    assert that(body1).equals('first response')

    request2 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
    body2 = request2.read()
    request2.close()
    assert that(request2.code).equals(202)
    assert that(body2).equals('second and last response')

    request3 = urllib2.urlopen('http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/httpretty')
    body3 = request3.read()
    request3.close()
    assert that(request3.code).equals(202)
    assert that(body3).equals('second and last response')


# Documentation

Unfortunately HTTPretty is lacking a documentation, but as for it is 100% based on [FakeWeb](http://fakeweb.rubyforge.org/), a good way to learn it is by looking at **HTTPretty** tests right [here](http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/HTTPretty/blob/master/tests/functional/test_urllib2.py)

# Dependencies

you will need **ONLY** if you decide to contribute to HTTPretty which means you're gonna need run our test suite

* [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/)
* [sure](http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/sure/)
* [httplib2](http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/)
* [bolacha](http://github.com/gabrielfalcao/bolacha/)
* [tornado](http://tornadoweb.org/)
